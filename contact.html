            <p>P.A.V.E. is a non-profit organization that is centered around improving the connections between adults and youth. We strive to help parents create an open dialog to discuss the issues that face our youth in the 21st century and ways to assist. Our primary goal is to provide parents with resources to use  in their families that build confidence and help resolve conflicts that hinder success in the younger population so that they see their future as positive and thriving.</p>

            <p>We believe in that old addege: "It takes a village to raise a child" and understand that the more involvement from the community increases family stability and self-sufficiency. Everyone can benefit when everyone is committed in doing their part in building a better life for all. And that is where YOU come in! Whether you are a parent, a family friend, a professional, or just a person interested in giving whatever skills you have...PAVE needs you! And we'd be thrilled to have you!</p>
            
            <p>So come join us! As a parent. As a friend. As a presenter. As a partner. No matter what designation, PAVE has a PLACE for you. You can reach us via email or the contact form below. We are waiting to hear from you!</p>
